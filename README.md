# University-Attendance-System

## Project Description

### Analysis and design of a system used to take automatically and manage attendance data. By scanning the ID cards of the students or employees, the information can be stored within the system like arrival time, date, departure time, and working hours. Accessing and editing the data is not possible for anyone except the admin. The proposed system maintains the previous employees' data to be able to check it in the future when necessary.,
